# General report
This document contains all the analysis performed so far for the gxp project.
I processed the raw fastq files through a several steps, including raw reads alignment, quality check, sorting and  annotation, using a pipeline that incorporates various tools such as FastQC, HISAT2, Samtools, HTseq and DEseq2.

List of batches analysed:
GxP1: 

•	220324_NS500258_0518_AHJG33BGXK (considered as old sequences)

•	221020_NS500258_0531_AHJF3GBGXK (considered as new sequences)

Then merged 

 
Script used:
For each batch, it was created a folder dedicated for the analysis and results.
Inside each folder(batch), three folders were created; “bams” for the alignment, “counts” for reads counting, and “deseq” for the differential gene expression analysis.
First step, in the “bams” folder the following scripts were added and launched.
run.sh
```
set={Folder to the fastq files for the specific batch}
ls /wsu/home/groups/piquelab/OurData/Nextseq/GxP/ ${set} | while read fastq_file; do echo ${fastq_file%_R*}; done | uniq > names.txt
cat names.txt | while read var; do sbatch --export=var=${var} align.sh; done
```
#align.sh is the bash script file that is being called by run.sh

#names.txt This file contains a list of all fastq files found and used for the alignment step. It is generated by run.sh
 
Second step, in the folder “counts” the following scripts were added and launched

run.sh
```
set={Folder to the fastq files for the specific batch}
ls /wsu/home/groups/piquelab/OurData/Nextseq/GxP/ ${set} | while read fastq_file; do echo ${fastq_file%_R*}; done | uniq > names.txt

mkdir counts2 #all file containing counts will be move to this folder
